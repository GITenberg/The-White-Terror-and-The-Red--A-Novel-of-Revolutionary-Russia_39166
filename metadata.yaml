description: Lithuanian-born author, journalist, and activist Abraham Cahan made a
  name for himself first with his investigative journalism and later with his fiction,
  much of which focused on the immigrant experience in America and specifically New
  York City. In The White Terror and the Red, however, the action unspools against
  the dramatic backdrop of the Russia's revolutionary struggles.
